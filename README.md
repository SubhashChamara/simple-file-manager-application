# Simple File Manager System

## Welcome to My File Manager System Project !

During my training period at IJSE (Institute of Software Engineering) as a Training Fullstack Developer, I developed a user-friendly file manager application. In Version-1 to practice Java SE file IO and javaFX, I added features like file storage, the ability to copy and paste files and folders, move files and folders, and delete files and folders. The application allows users to efficiently manage their files and folders, simplifying their organization and manipulation.

As I look forward to expanding the application, I aim to enhance my skills and knowledge in file management systems. Your suggestions for future improvements are welcome as I strive to learn and grow in this project.
